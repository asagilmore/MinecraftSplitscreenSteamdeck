# integration with Linux desktop environments.
#
# Functions provided:
# - create_desktop_launcher: Generate .desktop file for system integration
#
# =============================================================================

# create_desktop_launcher: Generate .desktop file for system integration
#
# DESKTOP LAUNCHER BENEFITS:
# - Native desktop environment integration (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)
# - Appears in application menus and search results
# - Desktop shortcut for quick access
# - Proper icon and metadata for professional appearance
# - Follows freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification
# - Works with all Linux desktop environments
#
# ICON HIERARCHY:
# 1. SteamGridDB custom icon (downloaded, professional appearance)
# 2. PollyMC instance icon (if PollyMC setup successful)
# 3. PrismLauncher instance icon (fallback)
# 4. System generic icon (ultimate fallback)
#
# DESKTOP FILE LOCATIONS:
# - Desktop shortcut: ~/Desktop/MinecraftSplitscreen.desktop
# - System integration: ~/.local/share/applications/MinecraftSplitscreen.desktop
